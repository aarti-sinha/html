        <span>Dear Reader,</span>
        <p>How    does it feel when someone breaks the queue and gets ahead of you?Suddenly you're angry. That person probably skipped moral science
          science classes.Morality,righteousness and ethics are at the centre of our today's first story as well.This month Axis Mutual
          fund suspended two fund managers -Viresh joshi and Deepak Agarwal -for alleged front-running .Front running is when a dealer 
          ,trader,or a mutual fund employee gets wind of a big order (for buying a selling shares) that will be placed by the fund or a 
          big investor and gets 'in Front' of the trade.Breaking the queue.A compliance head at an investment house says that there is 
          no way you can stop front -running.There is but one way.Our first story in today's edition of ET Prime unwraps more details.

        <p>While Axis MF has suspended two fund managers,Front-running is the most common malpractice as the Indian market lacks depth.
        Even though Sebi has highly sophisticated IT and AI systems to generate alerts,Perpetrators go about their misdeeds in Absence
        of a No-tolerance Policy against Front-running.</p>
